# FiltersAdapter
Adapter for Mozilla IoT Gateway implementing various filters as (virtual) devices

Version 0.1.0 implements
- a simple countdown timer
- a leading edge detector
- a flip-flop
- a square wave generator

## Countdown Timer
Basically each device has an input and an output and works like this:

```
input:  00001110001000111000000000000000000000000000
output: 00001111111111111111111111111111111000000000
                         <------time------>
```

So the output is active for some time after the input was active.

## Leading Edge Detector
Basically each device has an input and an output and works like this:

```
input:  0000111111111111111111111100000000000000
output: 0000111111110000000000000000000000000000
            <-time->             
```

So the output is active for some time after the input becomes active.

## Flip-Flop
Basically each device has an input and an output and works like this:

```
input:  0010101010101000000110011001100110011001100
output: 0011001100110000000111100001111000011110000
```

So the output changes every time the input changes from off to on. The time property is not used.

## Square Wave Generator
The input activates the generator

```
input:  000011111111111111111111111111111111111100000000000000
output: 000011111111000000001111111100000000111100000000000000
            <-time-><-time-><-time-><-time->             
```

So the output toggles as long as the input is active

## Configuration
Obviously CountdownTimer devices cannot be discovered by scanning for new devices. They need to be added/configured manually from the Addons list. The configuration is very simple:

## Rules
To use the device you add two Rules.

One for the input, connecting some switch or sensor to the input property of the filter.

One for the output, connecting the output property of the filter to some light or your toaster.
